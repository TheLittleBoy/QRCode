The _QRCodeReaderViewController_ was initialy a simple QRCode reader but it now lets you the possibility to specify the [format type](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AVFoundation/Reference/AVMetadataMachineReadableCodeObject_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Machine_Readable_Object_Types) you want to decode. It is based on the `AVFoundation` framework from Apple in order to replace ZXing or ZBar for iOS 7 and over.

It provides a default view controller to display the camera view with the scan area overlay and it also provides a button to switch between the front and the back cameras.
